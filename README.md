# connorfilter
This is a filter that muddles the base layer into 4 different saturations, while still retaining color to create a warped effect.  This is then overlayed by a multi colored transparent layer.

Only supports PNG Files.

Works with any size photo, but becomes slower the bigger the file.  Standard PNG should be 800 by 800 or less for maximum efficiency.
